# Ontology API — User Guide (Neo4j-backed)

A central HTTP API at `/api/v1/ontology/` that exposes CRUD over the
ontology graph stored in Neo4j. Hosted by the Studio app
(`apps/studio`, port 3500). All five artifact kinds — DataObjects,
Rules, Actions, Events, and Links (Neo4j relationships) — share one
base URL, one auth scheme, and one error shape.

This guide is for **API consumers** (link-generator, future builder
apps, agents, ad-hoc scripts). For the architecture and rationale see
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-ontology-api-design.md`](./superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-ontology-api-design.md).

## At a glance

| Group | Path prefix | Operations | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| DataObjects   | `/api/v1/ontology/objects`           | C R U D (PUT, PATCH, DELETE)   | Node label `:DataObject` |
| Rules         | `/api/v1/ontology/rules`             | C R U D                        | Node label `:Rule` |
| Actions       | `/api/v1/ontology/actions`           | C R U D                        | Node label `:Action` |
| Events        | `/api/v1/ontology/events`            | C R U D                        | Node label `:Event` |
| Links         | `/api/v1/ontology/links`             | C R U D                        | Neo4j relationships, identified by `linkId` |
| Schema        | `/api/v1/ontology/schema`            | R                              | Live property introspection |
| Action sub-resources | `/api/v1/ontology/actions/{ref}/...` | composite (rules-by-action, steps-by-action, per-action result writers) | `{ref}` matches `Action.id` then `Action.name` |

- **Base URL** — `http://localhost:3500` in dev. The `/api/v1/ontology`
  prefix is the API version path; future incompatible changes will land
  under `/api/v2/ontology`.
- **Content type** — JSON. Every request and response body is
  `application/json` unless the response is empty (e.g. `204 No
  Content`).
- **Versioning** — `/api/v1/ontology/...` is stable. Breaking changes
  ship behind a new path segment, never silently.

## Authentication

All endpoints require a shared bearer token. Configure it on the host
(Studio) via:

```bash
ONTOLOGY_API_TOKEN=<your-strong-random-key>
```

Send on every request via **either**:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

```http
x-api-key: <token>
```

Constant-time comparison server-side. Failure modes:

| Condition                                  | HTTP | `error`               |
|--------------------------------------------|------|-----------------------|
| Server has no `ONTOLOGY_API_TOKEN`         | 500  | `server-misconfigured`|
| Header missing                             | 401  | `unauthorized`        |
| Token present but wrong                    | 401  | `unauthorized`        |

---

## Common conventions

### Domain scoping

Every artifact is scoped to a domain (`RAAS-v1`, `R7-001`, …). Every
endpoint takes the domain as **either** a `?domain=…` query param
(reads, deletes, schema) **or** as a `domainId` field in the JSON body
(writes). The server adds `WHERE n.domainId = $domain` to every Cypher
match — there is no way to query across domains in v1.

| Operation          | Where domain goes              |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| `GET /…`           | `?domain=RAAS-v1`              |
| `GET /…/{id}`      | `?domain=RAAS-v1`              |
| `DELETE /…/{id}`   | `?domain=RAAS-v1`              |
| `POST /…`          | body: `{"domainId": "RAAS-v1", …}` |
| `PUT /…/{id}`      | body: `{"domainId": "RAAS-v1", …}` |
| `PATCH /…/{id}`    | body: `{"domainId": "RAAS-v1", …}` |

A request without a domain returns `400 missing-domain`.

### Property-bag semantics

The API is **schema-agnostic**. It does not hardcode field lists for
DataObject, Rule, Action, or Event. Whatever properties the client
sends are stored on the node verbatim; reads return whatever is
currently on the node. This is intentional — adding a new field in any
builder requires zero API changes.

Two consequences:

1. **No server-side field validation** beyond `id` (string, required)
   and `domainId` (string, required). The server does not reject
   unknown keys.
2. **Discover the actual fields** in use via the schema endpoint
   (`GET /api/v1/ontology/schema/{resource}?domain=…`).

### The flatten rule (writes only)

Neo4j only stores **primitives and arrays of primitives** as node
properties. The API handles this on writes:

- `string` / `number` / `boolean` / `null` → stored as-is
- `string[]` / `number[]` / `boolean[]` → stored as-is
- nested objects (`{ … }`) → JSON-stringified to a single property
- arrays of objects (`[{…}, {…}]`) → JSON-stringified

**Reads do not auto-inflate.** What the server stored is what you
get back. If you need the structured form, `JSON.parse()` the relevant
property on the client. (A future `?inflate=true` query param may
re-hydrate flattened properties; not in v1.)

### Pagination

List endpoints accept `?limit=N` (default 100, max 1000) and
`?cursor=…` (opaque token returned by the previous page). Iteration is
stable as long as `domainId` is fixed.

### Error shape

```json
{
  "error":   "<machine-readable-code>",
  "message": "<human-readable detail>",
  "details": { /* optional context, varies by error */ }
}
```

| HTTP | When                                                  | `error` examples |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| 400  | Invalid body, missing `id` / `domainId`, malformed query | `missing-domain`, `missing-id`, `invalid-json` |
| 401  | Auth missing / invalid                                | `unauthorized` |
| 404  | Resource not found                                    | `node-not-found`, `link-not-found` |
| 409  | Logical conflict (e.g. link references missing endpoint) | `endpoint-not-found`, `duplicate-id` |
| 500  | Server misconfigured, unexpected programmer error     | `server-misconfigured`, `internal-error` |
| 502  | Neo4j unreachable / driver error                      | `neo4j-unavailable` |

---

## 1. DataObjects, Rules, Actions, Events (generic node CRUD)

All four resources share an identical surface. Substitute `{resource}`
with `objects`, `rules`, `actions`, or `events`.

### `GET /api/v1/ontology/{resource}` — list

```http
GET /api/v1/ontology/objects?domain=RAAS-v1&limit=50 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Response — `200 OK`:

```json
{
  "items": [
    { "id": "Job_Requisition", "domainId": "RAAS-v1", "name": "招聘岗位", … },
    { "id": "Candidate",       "domainId": "RAAS-v1", "name": "候选人",   … }
  ],
  "nextCursor": null
}
```

Optional filters: `?id=…`, `?name=…` (top-level equality only in v1;
each becomes `WHERE n.<key> = $<key>` in the underlying Cypher). Use
the schema endpoint to discover legal property names.

### `POST /api/v1/ontology/{resource}` — create or bulk upsert

Single:

```http
POST /api/v1/ontology/objects HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "domainId": "RAAS-v1",
  "id":       "Job_Requisition",
  "name":     "招聘岗位",
  "description": "…",
  "fields":   [{ "name": "title", "type": "string" }]
}
```

Bulk (preferred for large imports):

```http
POST /api/v1/ontology/objects HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "domainId": "RAAS-v1",
  "items": [
    { "id": "A", "name": "…" },
    { "id": "B", "name": "…" }
  ]
}
```

Semantics: `MERGE` on `(id, domainId)`. Every `POST` is idempotent —
calling it twice with the same payload produces the same graph state.
Properties of an existing node are **fully replaced** by the request
body (same as `PUT`). Use `PATCH` for partial updates.

Response — `200 OK`:

```json
{ "upserted": ["Job_Requisition"], "count": 1 }
```

Bulk:

```json
{ "upserted": ["A", "B"], "count": 2 }
```

The `fields` array (and any other nested structure) is JSON-stringified
on storage; the read response will return it as a string.

### `GET /api/v1/ontology/{resource}/{ref}` — read one

```http
GET /api/v1/ontology/objects/Job_Requisition?domain=RAAS-v1 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

`{ref}` is matched first against the node's `id`, then any per-label
id-aliases (`Action.action_id` only in v1 — historical legacy from
older import pipelines), then the human-readable name field — so for
callers that only know an artifact by name, `/{resource}/{name}` works
too. The name field is per-resource: `name` for Objects, Actions, and
Events; `businessLogicRuleName` for Rules. Id matches always win when
both an id and a different artifact's name resolve to the same string;
aliases rank between id and name.

Response — `200 OK`:

```json
{
  "id":       "Job_Requisition",
  "domainId": "RAAS-v1",
  "name":     "招聘岗位",
  "fields":   "[{\"name\":\"title\",\"type\":\"string\"}]",
  "updatedAt": "2026-04-29T13:42:11.728+08:00"
}
```

`404 node-not-found` if no node matches `(ref, domainId)`.

### `PUT /api/v1/ontology/{resource}/{ref}` — replace

```http
PUT /api/v1/ontology/objects/Job_Requisition HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "domainId":    "RAAS-v1",
  "name":        "招聘岗位",
  "description": "Replaced description"
}
```

Replaces **all** properties on the node. The URL `{ref}` is resolved
to the node's actual `id` (id-then-name, id wins on ties); the body's
`domainId` plus the resolved `id` are merged in automatically.
Properties absent from the body are removed.

Response — `200 OK`: the new node.

### `PATCH /api/v1/ontology/{resource}/{ref}` — partial update

```http
PATCH /api/v1/ontology/objects/Job_Requisition HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "domainId":    "RAAS-v1",
  "description": "Updated description only"
}
```

Merges the supplied keys; leaves other properties untouched. To
explicitly remove a property, set it to `null` in the body.

Response — `200 OK`: the updated node.

### `DELETE /api/v1/ontology/{resource}/{ref}` — delete

```http
DELETE /api/v1/ontology/objects/Job_Requisition?domain=RAAS-v1 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Uses `DETACH DELETE` — the node and **all relationships touching it**
(in either direction) are removed. There is no soft-delete in v1.

Response — `200 OK`:

```json
{ "deleted": 1 }
```

`404 node-not-found` if `{ref}` resolves to neither an id nor a name
in the requested domain — same as GET. (Earlier revisions returned
`200 {deleted: 0}` for missing nodes; that idempotency promise was
dropped on 2026-05-08 along with the name-fallback rollout, since
returning 404 on a typo'd ref is more useful than silent success.
A `200 {deleted: 0}` response is still possible in the rare TOCTOU
window where the node disappears between the resolver step and the
delete step.)

---

## 2. Schema introspection

Discover what properties currently exist on a label, sampled from live
Neo4j. The API does not maintain a static schema — this endpoint
**is** the schema.

### `GET /api/v1/ontology/schema?domain=…` — all four labels

```http
GET /api/v1/ontology/schema?domain=RAAS-v1 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

```json
{
  "domain": "RAAS-v1",
  "labels": [
    { "label": "DataObject", "resource": "objects", "sampledNodes": 100,
      "properties": [
        { "name": "id",       "occurrence": 100 },
        { "name": "domainId", "occurrence": 100 },
        { "name": "name",     "occurrence": 98 },
        …
      ] },
    { "label": "Rule",   "resource": "rules",   … },
    { "label": "Action", "resource": "actions", … },
    { "label": "Event",  "resource": "events",  … }
  ]
}
```

### `GET /api/v1/ontology/schema/{resource}?domain=…` — one label

```http
GET /api/v1/ontology/schema/rules?domain=RAAS-v1 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

```json
{
  "label":        "Rule",
  "resource":     "rules",
  "domain":       "RAAS-v1",
  "sampledNodes": 100,
  "properties": [
    { "name": "id",                       "occurrence": 100 },
    { "name": "domainId",                 "occurrence": 100 },
    { "name": "businessLogicRuleName",    "occurrence": 100 },
    { "name": "specificScenarioStage",    "occurrence": 100 },
    { "name": "applicableClient",         "occurrence":  87 },
    …
  ]
}
```

Sampling: the first 100 nodes (per Cypher's natural ordering — not
deterministic, but adequate for "which fields are commonly used"). For
exact occurrence counts increase the sample with `?sample=N` (max
1000).

---

## 3. Links (Neo4j relationships)

Links are stored as **edges**, not nodes, between existing nodes
(typically two `:DataObject`s, but any-to-any is supported). Each link
is identified by a `linkId` property the server stores on the
relationship; if a client doesn't supply one at create time, the
server generates a UUID v4.

### `GET /api/v1/ontology/links` — list

```http
GET /api/v1/ontology/links?domain=RAAS-v1&type=HAS_FIELD HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Optional filters: `?type=…`, `?from=<sourceId>`, `?to=<targetId>`.

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "linkId":   "f3d1c8e2-…",
      "type":     "HAS_FIELD",
      "fromId":   "Job_Requisition",
      "fromLabel":"DataObject",
      "toId":     "field_title",
      "toLabel":  "DataObject",
      "domainId": "RAAS-v1",
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "updatedAt": "2026-04-29T13:42:11.728+08:00"
    }
  ],
  "nextCursor": null
}
```

### `POST /api/v1/ontology/links` — create

```http
POST /api/v1/ontology/links HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "domainId":   "RAAS-v1",
  "type":       "HAS_FIELD",
  "fromId":     "Job_Requisition",
  "toId":       "field_title",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "linkId":     "optional-client-supplied-id"
}
```

Constraints:

- `type` must match `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{0,63}$` (Neo4j relationship type
  rule + an allowlist enforced by the server). Unknown types return
  `400 invalid-link-type`.
- The endpoint nodes (`fromId`, `toId`) must already exist in the
  domain. If either is missing the call returns `409
  endpoint-not-found` with a `details.missing` array.
- `linkId` is optional; when omitted the server generates a UUID v4.

Response — `200 OK`:

```json
{ "linkId": "f3d1c8e2-2a4b-4d8c-9f1d-7e6c5b4a3f2d" }
```

### `GET /api/v1/ontology/links/{linkId}` — read one

```http
GET /api/v1/ontology/links/f3d1c8e2-…?domain=RAAS-v1 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### `PUT /api/v1/ontology/links/{linkId}` / `PATCH .../{linkId}`

Same semantics as nodes (PUT replaces all properties; PATCH merges).
You **cannot** change `type`, `fromId`, or `toId` on an existing link
— delete and re-create instead.

### `DELETE /api/v1/ontology/links/{linkId}`

```http
DELETE /api/v1/ontology/links/f3d1c8e2-…?domain=RAAS-v1 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Response — `200 OK`:

```json
{ "deleted": 1 }
```

---

## 4. Action sub-resources

Composite endpoints under `/api/v1/ontology/actions/{ref}/...` that
aren't generic CRUD — they assemble multi-node graph shapes in one
call:

- two **reads** that traverse `(:Action)-[:HAS_STEP]->(:ActionStep)`
  (and, for `/rules`, the further `(:Rule)-[:GOVERNS]->(:ActionStep)`)
  to return either the steps or the steps + rules attached to an Action;
- a **per-action write** that records an instance of an action's
  outcome (currently only `matchResume`).

All three endpoints accept `{ref}` as either the Action's `id` or its
`name` (id wins on ties), and require `?domain=…`. The Action match
itself is domain-scoped: an Action created in domain `RAAS-v1` is
invisible from `?domain=other-domain`.

### `GET /api/v1/ontology/actions/{ref}/rules`

Returns the Action identified by `{ref}` (within the supplied domain)
together with its `(:ActionStep)` children and the rules attached to
each step. `{ref}` is matched against `Action.id` first, then
`Action.action_id`, then `Action.name` — id wins on ties.

Step discovery is dual-path: linked steps via
`(:Action)-[:HAS_STEP]->(:ActionStep)` AND, when no linked steps exist,
fallback steps whose `action_id` / `actionId` / `parentActionId`
property matches the Action's id (or `action_id` alias). Some import
pipelines stamp the parent ref on the step instead of creating the
relationship; both shapes are surfaced.

Rules attach to each step via two relationship directions —
`(:Rule)-[:GOVERNS]->(:ActionStep)` AND
`(:ActionStep)-[:CHECKS]->(:Rule)` — and via a JSON-stringified
`step.rules_json` / `step.rulesJson` / `step.rules` property fallback.
Ids found only in the JSON fallback are hydrated by a single batched
follow-up query against `(:Rule)`.

Steps + rules are scoped to the same `?domain=…`. Step order falls
back through `coalesce(s.order, s.index, "0")` to tolerate the
inconsistent ordering schemas different import pipelines produce.

Query params:

| Name      | Required | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| `domain`  | yes      | Scopes the Action match, the steps list, and the rules list. |

```bash
curl -sS \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ONTOLOGY_API_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:3500/api/v1/ontology/actions/matchResume/rules?domain=RAAS-v1" | jq
```

Response — `200 OK`: a single Action object with nested
`action_steps[]` (each step's rules in `step.rules`), a flattened
deduped `rules[]` at the top level, a `ruleCount`, and a compiled
`userPrompt` suitable for handing directly to an LLM:

```json
{
  "id":          "matchResume",
  "name":        "matchResume",
  "description": "...",
  "action_steps": [
    {
      "id":    "step-1",
      "name":  "Hard requirements",
      "order": 1,
      "condition": "...",
      "rules": [
        { "id": "10-HARD-DEGREE", "businessLogicRuleName": "...", "executor": "Agent" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "rules": [
    { "id": "10-HARD-DEGREE", "businessLogicRuleName": "...", "executor": "Agent" }
  ],
  "ruleCount": 1,
  "userPrompt": "# Ontology rules for Action matchResume (matchResume)\n\nUse the following ontology rules ..."
}
```

Each rule carries a curated subset of the `(:Rule)` node's properties
— `id`, `businessLogicRuleName`, `standardizedLogicRule`,
`submissionCriteria`, `executor`, `ruleSource`, `applicableClient`.
For the full property catalog stored on the node, call the schema
introspection endpoint (`GET /api/v1/ontology/schema/rules?domain=…`).
Steps without an explicit `id` get a synthesized
`${actionId}::${stepName}` so callers always have a stable handle.

Errors:

| HTTP | `error` |
|------|---------|
| 400  | `missing-domain` |
| 401  | `unauthorized` |
| 404  | `action-not-found` |
| 500  | `server-misconfigured` |
| 502  | `neo4j-unavailable` |

### `GET /api/v1/ontology/actions/{ref}/steps`

Returns the Action together with its `(:ActionStep)` children, ordered
by `step.order`. Same lookup and domain rules as `/rules`, but the
response omits the per-step rule list — useful when you only need the
step structure (e.g. rendering an Action's pipeline).

Query params:

| Name      | Required | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| `domain`  | yes      | Scopes both the Action match and the steps list. |

```bash
curl -sS \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ONTOLOGY_API_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:3500/api/v1/ontology/actions/matchResume/steps?domain=RAAS-v1" | jq
```

Response — `200 OK`: a single Action object with `action_steps[]` (no
`rules` nesting):

```json
{
  "id":          "matchResume",
  "name":        "matchResume",
  "description": "...",
  "action_steps": [
    { "id": "step-1", "name": "Hard requirements", "order": 1 },
    { "id": "step-2", "name": "Conflict-of-interest checks", "order": 2 }
  ]
}
```

Errors: same set as `/rules`.

### `POST /api/v1/ontology/actions/matchResume/results`

Persists a new `(:Candidate_Match_Result)` node, MERGE-ing
`(:Candidate)` and `(:Job_Requisition)` stub nodes if they don't yet
exist, then linking:

```
(:Candidate_Match_Result)-[:candidate_match_result_refers_to_candidate]->(:Candidate)
(:Candidate_Match_Result)-[:candidate_match_result_refers_to_job_requisition]->(:Job_Requisition)
```

Every call adds a **new** history record — the endpoint never
overwrites.

Body:

```json
{
  "candidateId":   "C-100023",
  "jobPositionId": "JR-50087",
  "result":        "匹配",
  "reason":        "…"
}
```

All four fields are required strings.

Response — `200 OK`:

```json
{
  "candidateMatchResultId": "f3d1c8e2-2a4b-4d8c-9f1d-7e6c5b4a3f2d",
  "createdAt":              "2026-04-29T13:42:11.728+08:00"
}
```

`candidateMatchResultId` is a server-generated UUID v4 stored as
`Candidate_Match_Result.candidate_match_result_id`. `createdAt` is the
node's `datetime()` rendered as ISO 8601 with offset.

> **Why per-action and not generic?** Composite writes that MERGE

## Server configuration

Set on the Studio host (`apps/studio/.env.local` or via deployment
environment):

| Variable                | Required | Purpose |
|-------------------------|----------|---------|
| `ONTOLOGY_API_TOKEN`    | yes      | Shared bearer token for all `/api/v1/ontology/*` endpoints. No default — endpoints return `500` until set. |
| `NEO4J_URI`             | yes      | Bolt endpoint, e.g. `bolt://localhost:7687` |
| `NEO4J_USER`            | yes      | Account |
| `NEO4J_PASSWORD`        | yes      | Password |
| `NEO4J_DATABASE`        | no       | Multi-db routing target (default: `neo4j`) |

The dev cluster default in this repo is
`bolt://10.100.0.70:7687` — set `NEO4J_URI` accordingly.

## Caveats and known limitations

### Schema-agnostic = no field-level validation

The API trusts the client. Sending `{"id": "x", "domainId": "y",
"randomTypo": 123}` will store `randomTypo` on the node. Use the
schema endpoint to verify field names; consider adding a check in your
client. The repo's TypeScript types in `@allmeta/ontology-core` are a
good source of truth for what fields *should* exist on each artifact —
but the API does not enforce them.

### Reads do not auto-inflate JSON-stringified properties

If you POST `{"fields": [{"name": "title"}]}` you'll get back
`"fields": "[{\"name\":\"title\"}]"`. Parse on the client. A future
`?inflate=true` knob may add automatic re-hydration.

### Domain isolation is a hard rail

There is no cross-domain query in v1. Every Cypher includes `WHERE
n.domainId = $domain`. To join across domains, the consumer must call
the API once per domain and merge client-side. (This is a deliberate
choice — most current consumers want one-domain-at-a-time semantics
and accidental cross-domain reads are the most common bug class in
the existing per-builder deploy routes.)

### Link type is part of identity, can't be PATCHed

Once a relationship has a type, you can't change it via PATCH — Neo4j
relationships are typed at creation. `DELETE` the link and create a
new one with the new type.

### `DELETE` on missing resources returns `404`, not `200`

`DELETE /objects/foo?domain=…` returns `404 node-not-found` when the
ref resolves to neither an id nor a name. Same shape as `GET`. (Up
through 2026-05-07 this returned `200 {deleted: 0}` instead — see the
2026-05-08 Changelog entry for the rationale.) A `200 {deleted: 0}`
response is now only possible in the TOCTOU window between the
resolver step and the delete itself.

### No bulk DELETE in v1

Loop over single deletes, or call the underlying Neo4j directly for
mass cleanup. A `?bulk=true&where=…` deletion endpoint may follow
once a real consumer needs it.

### No transactions across endpoints

Each HTTP call is its own Neo4j transaction. There is no
`begin/commit/rollback` API. Multi-step graph mutations either go
inside one `POST` (via the bulk-upsert body) or accept partial-failure
risk between calls.

### Rate limits / retries

The dev cluster is small. Bulk-upsert in batches of ≤500 items per
call. There is no server-side rate limit in v1, but Neo4j will reject
oversized parameter blobs (~1 MB) with `502`.

### What's **not** in v1

- No Workflow CRUD (intentionally — only the 5 listed kinds).
- No `ActionStep` as a top-level resource (surfaced only via
  `/actions/{ref}/rules` and `/actions/{ref}/steps`).
- No raw-Cypher passthrough endpoint.
- The per-app deploy routes in objects-builder / rules-builder / etc.
  are not part of this API; they keep using their own Neo4j drivers.
- No auth scopes / per-caller API keys — one shared token gates the
  whole surface.
- No request body schema validation against TypeScript types.

## Changelog

### 2026-05-08 — Name-fallback on bare CRUD; `/actions/{ref}/steps`; `/rules` shape change

Three coordinated changes that align all `/actions/{ref}/...` endpoints
on the same lookup + scoping convention, and add a steps-only read.

**Endpoint additions:**
- `GET /api/v1/ontology/actions/{ref}/steps?domain=…` — Action plus
  ordered `action_steps[]`, no per-step rule nesting.

**Endpoint behavior changes:**

*Bare CRUD (`/{resource}/{ref}`):*

| Endpoint | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /{resource}/{id}`, `PUT/PATCH/DELETE /{resource}/{id}` | strict-id match | id matched first, then resource's name field (`name` for objects/actions/events; `businessLogicRuleName` for rules); id wins on ties. URL param renamed `{id}` → `{ref}` in docs but path shape is unchanged. |
| `DELETE /{resource}/{id}` on missing node | `200 OK { "deleted": 0 }` (idempotent silent success) | `404 node-not-found` (matches GET shape; surfaces typo'd refs to the caller). A `200 {deleted: 0}` response is now only possible in the TOCTOU window between the internal resolver step and the actual delete. |

*Action sub-resources (`/actions/{ref}/...`):*

| Endpoint | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/ontology/actions/{id}/rules` | `?domainId=…` (optional, post-filter on rules; Action match was global) | `?domain=…` (required); Action match scoped by domain; steps + rules also filtered by domain. URL `{id}` becomes `{ref}` (id-then-name). |
| `GET /api/v1/ontology/actions/{id}/rules` response | array of one Action: `[{...action, action_steps: [...]}]` | single Action object: `{...action, action_steps: [...]}` |

**Why:**

- `/actions/{ref}/rules` was the only endpoint in the API where the
  base resource match was global (no domain scoping) and the param was
  spelled `?domainId=` instead of the `?domain=` used everywhere else.
  Aligning it pays the breaking-change tax once instead of twice.
- The array-of-one response shape on `/rules` was a historical artifact;
  `{ref}` always resolves to a single Action, so a single-object response
  matches the path semantics. `/steps` ships as single-object from day
  one to avoid carrying the same artifact forward.
- Bare CRUD callers regularly know an artifact only by name (e.g.
  `Job_Requisition` is the id, but `招聘岗位` is what humans use).
  Name-fallback removes the round-trip lookup callers had to do client-
  side, while keeping id matches deterministic on collisions.

**Migration:**

- Callers of `/actions/{id}/rules` must:
  - rename `?domainId=` → `?domain=` (param is now required);
  - replace `body[0]` indexing with direct field access on the response;
  - if relying on cross-domain matching, query each domain explicitly.
- Callers of `/{resource}/{id}` GET see no behavioral change unless
  they pass a name where they used to pass an id — that case now
  succeeds instead of 404'ing.
- Callers of `DELETE /{resource}/{id}` that depended on the old
  idempotent `200 {deleted: 0}` response on missing nodes must now
  expect `404 node-not-found`. If you were swallowing that response
  silently, you'll now see the 404 surface. (This is intentional —
  surfacing typo'd refs is more useful than silent success.)
- No back-compat shim. Internal call sites update in lock-step with
  this doc; downstream adopters switch over the same revision.

**Implementation notes:**

- Each bare-CRUD item operation now does two Cypher round-trips
  (resolver → main op). The resolver query is index-backed
  (`(:Label, id, domainId)`), so the latency delta is bounded —
  typically ~1ms on a hot index. Plan revisits this if the cost
  shows up in profiling.
- 404 messages on action sub-resources are standardized to
  `Action not found for selector "${ref}" in domain ${domain}`.
  The TOCTOU branch (an Action that disappeared between the resolver
  and the main query) returns a distinct
  `Action ${actionId} disappeared between resolve and fetch` so
  log-grep can tell the two cases apart. Error codes are unchanged
  (`action-not-found` in both cases).
- The shared resolver lives at `handlers/nodes.ts` as
  `resolveIdFor(label, ref, domain): Promise<string | null>`,
  exported within the package and consumed by both `createNodeIdRoute`
  (bare CRUD) and the action sub-resource handlers. New action
  sub-resources should import it from there rather than reimplementing
  the id-then-name lookup.

**Post-rebase port (later same day):** when the branch was rebased
onto a main that had independently expanded the legacy `match-resume`
endpoint, the enhancements were merged forward into the new
`/actions/{ref}/...` handlers rather than dropped. Specifically:

- `buildResolveRef` generalized from a single name-field to an ordered
  `matchFields` list. A new `ID_ALIAS_FIELDS: Record<NodeLabel, string[]>`
  config lets each label declare extra id-like columns; only `Action`
  uses it (carrying `action_id` between `id` and `name` in resolver
  priority).
- The `/actions/{ref}/rules` Cypher gained dual step discovery
  (linked via `HAS_STEP` plus fallback via `step.action_id` /
  `step.actionId` / `step.parentActionId`), bidirectional rule
  traversal (`(:Rule)-[:GOVERNS]->(:ActionStep)` AND
  `(:ActionStep)-[:CHECKS]->(:Rule)`), and a `rules_json` /
  `rulesJson` / `rules` property fallback for rule ids not reachable
  via either relationship — enriched in a single batched follow-up
  query.
- Step ordering coalesces `s.order` → `s.index` → `"0"`. Steps
  without an explicit `id` are synthesized as `${actionId}::${stepName}`.
- The `/actions/{ref}/rules` response gained three derived fields:
  a top-level deduped `rules[]`, a `ruleCount`, and a compiled
  `userPrompt` (multi-line markdown ready to hand to an LLM).
- The `/actions/{ref}/steps` Cypher picked up the same dual step
  discovery and `coalesce`-based ordering. Its response shape is
  unchanged otherwise (single object, no rule nesting).

### 2026-05-07 — Action sub-resources replace `/match-resume/*`

The two purpose-specific endpoints under `/api/v1/ontology/match-resume/*`
are renamed to live under `/api/v1/ontology/actions/{id}/...` so they
compose with future Actions instead of forcing a new top-level
namespace per action.

**Endpoint moves:**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `GET /api/v1/ontology/match-resume/rules?actionId=…&actionName=…&domainId=…` | `GET /api/v1/ontology/actions/{id}/rules?domainId=…` |
| `POST /api/v1/ontology/match-resume/result` | `POST /api/v1/ontology/actions/matchResume/results` |

**Behavior changes:**

- `actionId` / `actionName` query params on the rules read are folded
  into the path segment `{id}`, which is matched against `Action.id`
  first and falls back to `Action.name`. The implicit
  `actionName=matchResume` default no longer applies — the caller must
  name the action explicitly in the path. To migrate, replace
  `/match-resume/rules` (no params) with `/actions/matchResume/rules`.
- The result writer pluralizes `result` → `results` to match REST
  convention for create-on-collection (each call appends a new
  history record).
- Request body and response shapes are unchanged for both endpoints,
  so client code only updates URLs.

**Why:**

- The original `/match-resume/*` namespace was a temporary lift from
  rules-builder. As more actions need similar endpoints (e.g.
  `scoreCandidate`, `generateOffer`), the per-action sub-resource
  shape (`/actions/{id}/rules`, `/actions/{id}/results`) scales
  without adding a new top-level path each time.
- Filtering rules by an action is a graph traversal
  (`(:Action)-[:HAS_STEP]->(:ActionStep)<-[:GOVERNS]-(:Rule)`) which
  is meaningfully different from the property-equality filter on
  `GET /rules`. Keeping it on its own path (sub-resource of
  `/actions`) makes the distinction explicit instead of overloading
  `GET /rules` with a branch on `?actionId=`.
- A generic `POST /instances/{label}` writer was considered for the
  result endpoint but rejected at this stage. Composite writes that
  MERGE foreign-key stubs are domain-shaped (each action knows which
  inputs map to which target nodes / relationship types) and a
  one-sample generic body design risks the wrong abstraction. Keep
  per-action result writers for now; revisit when a second action
  needs one.

**No back-compat:** the old `/match-resume/*` paths are removed in
this revision rather than aliased. Internal call sites update in
lock-step with this doc; downstream adopters switch to the new
paths. Search the repo for `match-resume` to find every site that
needs updating.
